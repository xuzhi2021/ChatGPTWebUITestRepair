I apologize for the inconsistency in my previous answer. After reviewing the attributes again, I have selected a new candidate element that is most similar to the target element.

The most similar element's numericId: 28. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, x, y, width, height, isLeaf.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/table[2]/tbody[1]/tr[1]/td[5]/a[1]/img[1]")).click();
