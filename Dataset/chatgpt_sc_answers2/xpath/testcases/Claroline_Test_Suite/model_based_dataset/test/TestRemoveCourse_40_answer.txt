I apologize for the inconsistency in my previous answer. Let me provide you with a revised answer.

The most similar element's numericId: 83. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, x, y, width, height, and isLeaf.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/table[2]/tbody[1]/tr[1]/td[5]/a[1]/img[1]")).click();
