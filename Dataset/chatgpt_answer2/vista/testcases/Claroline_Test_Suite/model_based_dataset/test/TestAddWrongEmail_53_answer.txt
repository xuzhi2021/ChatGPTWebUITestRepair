The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "The email address is not valid");

Explanation: 
The broken statement was checking the text of an element using an incorrect xpath. Based on the selected element {numericId=39, id='', name='', class='claroDialogMsg msgError', xpath='/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]', text='The email address is not valid', tagName='div', linkText='', x=40, y=158, width=876, height=18, isLeaf=true}, the repaired statement uses the correct xpath to locate the element and compare its text with the expected value "The email address is not valid".
