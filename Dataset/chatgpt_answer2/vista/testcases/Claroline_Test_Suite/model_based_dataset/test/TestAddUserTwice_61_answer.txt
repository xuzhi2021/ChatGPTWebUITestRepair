The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]")).click();

Explanation: 
The repaired statement replaces the locator of the element with a more accurate XPath locator. The selected element has a similar XPath locator, "/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div[1]/div[1]", which points to the same element on the page. The outdated assertion is not mentioned in the broken statement, so it remains unchanged.
