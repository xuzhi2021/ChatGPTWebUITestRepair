The most similar element's numericId: 56. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, text, tagName, linkText, x, y, width, height, isLeaf.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/form[1]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[1]/td[2]/span[4]/a[1]")).click();

Explanation: 

The repaired statement uses the xpath locator "/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/form[1]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[1]/td[2]/span[4]/a[1]" which corresponds to the selected element with the numericId=56. This xpath locator is more specific and provides the exact path to the "Profiles" link.

Additionally, the outdated assertion "href='account_prof_menu_page.php'" has been removed as it is no longer needed with the updated locator.
