The most similar element's numericId: 68. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: 

String successMessage = driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText();
Assert.assertEquals(successMessage, "Exercise added");

Explanation:
- I have updated the XPath locator to identify the element.
- I have assigned the text of the element to a variable named "successMessage".
- The assertion now compares the value of "successMessage" with the expected value "Exercise added".
