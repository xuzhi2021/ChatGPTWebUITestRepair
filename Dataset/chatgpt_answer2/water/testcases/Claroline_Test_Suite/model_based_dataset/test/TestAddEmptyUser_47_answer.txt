The most similar element's numericId: 40. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]")).getText(), "You typed two different passwords");

Explanation: 
- The id attribute is missing, so we cannot use it in the updated statement.
- The xpath locator in the repaired statement is updated to "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]" based on the selected element.
- The outdated assertion is not changed as it is still verifying if the text is "You typed two different passwords".
