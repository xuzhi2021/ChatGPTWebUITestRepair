The most similar element's numericId: 10. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: 
Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]")).getText(), "You have just created the course website : 225");

Explanation: 
I have updated the XPath locator in the findElement method to match the selected element's XPath ("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]"). Also, I removed the extra closing parenthesis after ".getText()" and provided the expected text "You have just created the course website : 225" as the second argument to the assertEquals method.
