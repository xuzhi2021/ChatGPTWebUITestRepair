The most similar element's numericId: 146. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, tagName, text, x, y, width, height.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[4]/form[1]/input[11]")).sendKeys(list.get(i).getYear());

Explanation: 

- The selected element has a similar xpath to the broken statement's xpath, so we can use it as the updated xpath.
- The selected element is an input element, so we can assume that the updated locator should also be an input element.
- The selected element's xpath is "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[4]/form[1]/input[11]", so we can update the xpath in the broken statement with this value.
- We don't need the assertion part in this repaired statement as it is not provided in the original broken statement.
