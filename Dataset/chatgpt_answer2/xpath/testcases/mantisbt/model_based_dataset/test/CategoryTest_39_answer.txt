The most similar element's numericId: 45. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, text, tagName, linkText, x, y, width, height, and isLeaf.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]")).click();

Explanation: I have chosen the element with the xpath "/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]" as the most similar element to the target element "Manage Projects". 
So, the repaired statement is using the xpath locator for the element and the outdated assertion of the href attribute is removed since it is not necessary for the click action.

Result of repaired statement: The element with the xpath "/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]" will be clicked.
