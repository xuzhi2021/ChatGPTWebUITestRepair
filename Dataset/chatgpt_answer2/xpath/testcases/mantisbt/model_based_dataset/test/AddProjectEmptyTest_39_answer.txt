Repaired statement: 

driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]")).click(); 

Explanation: 

- Updated xpath locator to match the selected element: "/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]".
- Removed the attribute condition "href='manage_proj_page.php'" since it was not present in the selected element.
- No assertion was provided in the broken statement, so no outdated assertion needs to be updated.
