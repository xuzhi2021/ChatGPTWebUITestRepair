The most similar element's numericId: 57. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, text, tagName, class.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[4]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[3]/a[1]")).getText(), "Event added to the agenda.");

Explanation: 
- The locator in the broken statement is targeting an element with xpath `//*[@id="courseRightContent"]/div[2]/div`.
- The updated locator based on the selected element is `/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[4]/div[1]/ul[1]/li[3]/a[1]`.
- The outdated assertion in the broken statement is comparing the text of the element with itself, which is not necessary.
- The repaired statement updates the locator and removes the unnecessary assertion, comparing the text of the selected element with the expected text "Event added to the agenda."
