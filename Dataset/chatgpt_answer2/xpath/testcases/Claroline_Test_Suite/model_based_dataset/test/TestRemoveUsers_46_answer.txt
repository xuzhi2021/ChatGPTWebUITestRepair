The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div")).getText(), "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully");

Explanation: 
The broken statement has an incorrect XPath locator. The updated XPath locator "/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div" points to the selected element, which is similar to the target element. The updated assertion remains the same, comparing the text of the element to the expected value "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully".
