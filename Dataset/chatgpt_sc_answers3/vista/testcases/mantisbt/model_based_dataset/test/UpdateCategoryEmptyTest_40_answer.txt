I apologize for the inconsistency in my previous answer. After reviewing the elements again, I have identified the correct most similar element.

The most similar element's numericId: 106. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, tagName, text.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/table[3]/tbody[1]/tr[1]/td[1]/address[1]/a[@href='manage_user_page.php']")).click();
