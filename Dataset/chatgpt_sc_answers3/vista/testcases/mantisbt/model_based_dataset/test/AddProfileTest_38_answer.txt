I apologize for the inconsistency in my previous answer. Upon reviewing the attributes of the candidate elements again, I have identified the most similar element to the target element.

The most similar element's numericId: 106. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, text, and tagName.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/table[3]/tbody[1]/tr[1]/td[1]/address[1]/a")).click();
