I apologize for the inconsistency in my previous answer. After reviewing the attributes again, I have selected a new element that is most similar to the target element. 

The most similar element's numericId: 54. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, tagName, text, x, y, width, height, isLeaf.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[4]/form[1]/input[4]")).sendKeys(list.get(i).getYear());
