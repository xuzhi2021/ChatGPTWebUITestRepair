The most similar element's numericId: 40. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: 

```java
Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]")).getText(), "You typed two different passwords");
```

Explanation: 

The repaired statement updates the XPath locator to `/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]` based on the selected element's XPath. This updated XPath points to the element with the similar text "You typed two different passwords". The assertion remains the same, comparing the text of the element with the expected value.
