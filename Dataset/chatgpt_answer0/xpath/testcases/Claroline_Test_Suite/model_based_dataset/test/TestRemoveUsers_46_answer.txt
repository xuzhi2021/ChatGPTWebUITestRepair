The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully");

Explanation: 
- I replaced the old XPath locator "//div[@id='claroBody']/div[2]/div" with the new XPath locator "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" based on the selected element.
- The assertion message remains the same.
