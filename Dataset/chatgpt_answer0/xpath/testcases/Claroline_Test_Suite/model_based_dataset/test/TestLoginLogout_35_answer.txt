The most similar element's numericId: 24. Because they share the most similar attributes: class (blockHeader vs header), xpath, text ('Authentication'), tagName (h3 vs div), x, y, width, height, isLeaf (true vs true).
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Authentication");

In the repaired statement, I have updated the xpath locator to match the selected element. I have also replaced the outdated assertion method `assertTrue` with `assertEquals` to compare the text value with "Authentication".
