The most similar element's numericId: 40. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: 

driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div[2]")).click();

Note: Since the provided candidate element does not have an ID attribute, I have updated the XPath locator to match the selected element. The outdated assertion is not mentioned in the broken statement, so it cannot be updated.
