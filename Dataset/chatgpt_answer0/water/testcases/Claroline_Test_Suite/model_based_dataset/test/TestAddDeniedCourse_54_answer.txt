The most similar element's numericId: 22. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]")).getText(), "You have just created the course website : 225");

Explanation: 
- I replaced the original xpath locator with a new one that points to the selected element: "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[3]".
- I removed the redundant "getText()" method from the second argument of the assertion.
- The expected value remains the same: "You have just created the course website : 225".
