Repaired statement: 

Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Exercise added");

Explanation: 
Based on the selected element, the updated locator would be "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]". The outdated assertion of the broken statement has been replaced with the correct assertion "Exercise added".
