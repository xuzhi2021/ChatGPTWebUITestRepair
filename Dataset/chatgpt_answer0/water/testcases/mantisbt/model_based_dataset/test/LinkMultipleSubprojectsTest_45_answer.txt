Repaired statement: 

driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]")).click();

Explanation: 
The repaired statement updates the XPath locator to match the selected element's XPath ("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]"). This will ensure that the correct element is located on the page. 

Additionally, the outdated assertion "[@href='manage_proj_page.php']" is removed as it is not present in the selected element's attributes.
