The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement:

String successMessage = driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText();
assertEquals(successMessage, "The new user has been successfully created");

Explanation:
- I have updated the XPath locator to "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" based on the selected element.
- I have stored the text of the selected element in a variable called "successMessage".
- Then, I have updated the assertion to compare the "successMessage" variable with the expected text "The new user has been successfully created".
