The most similar element's numericId: 68. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: 

Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Event added to the agenda.");

Explanation:

- The locator in the previous statement was incorrect, as it was missing the complete XPath of the element.
- The repaired statement uses the XPath "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" to locate the element.
- The outdated assertion in the previous statement is also fixed in the repaired statement.
- The repaired statement asserts that the text of the selected element is equal to "Event added to the agenda."
