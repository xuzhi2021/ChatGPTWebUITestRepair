Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText().trim(),
"The changes have been carried out correctly textzone_top.inc.html");

Explanation: 
- The locator has been updated to the correct XPath of the selected element: "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[1]".
- The assertion has been updated to use "assertEquals" instead of "assertTrue" to compare the exact text value.
- ".trim()" has been added to remove any leading or trailing white spaces from the text.
