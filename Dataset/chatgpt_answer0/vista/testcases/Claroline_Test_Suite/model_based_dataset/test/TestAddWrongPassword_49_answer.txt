The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they have the same class ('claroDialogMsg msgError'), the same xpath ('/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]'), and the same text ('You typed two different passwords').
Repaired statement: 

Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(),
"You typed two different passwords");

Explanation: 
I replaced the locator value from "//*[@id=\"claroBody\"]/div[2]/div[1]" to "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" based on the selected element. This new locator represents the same element as the selected one.

Also, it seems that there is an extra closing parenthesis in the original statement, so I removed it in the repaired statement.
