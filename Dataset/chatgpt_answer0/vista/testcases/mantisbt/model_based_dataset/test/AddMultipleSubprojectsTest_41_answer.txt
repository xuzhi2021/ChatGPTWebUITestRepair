The most similar element's numericId: 87. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, tagName, x, y, width, height, isLeaf.
Repaired statement: 

driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[3]/td[2]")).click();

Explanation:
Based on the selected element, we can see that the target element is a <td> element located at /html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[3]/td[2]. So, we can update the XPath locator in the repaired statement accordingly.

However, the repaired statement does not include the same assertion as the original statement. If there was an assertion based on the link with href attribute value "manage_user_page.php", it needs to be added separately.
