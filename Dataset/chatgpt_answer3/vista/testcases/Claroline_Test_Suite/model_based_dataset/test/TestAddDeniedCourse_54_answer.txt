Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "You have just created the course website : 225");

Explanation: 
The updated locator is based on the selected element with the numericId=35. The xpath is "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]". The outdated assertion is replaced with the expected text "You have just created the course website : 225".
