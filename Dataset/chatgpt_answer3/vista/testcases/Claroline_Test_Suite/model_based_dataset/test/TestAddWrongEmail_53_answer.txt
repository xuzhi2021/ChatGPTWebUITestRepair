The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "The email address is not valid");

Explanation: The repaired statement updates the locator in the `By.xpath()` method to match the selected element's `xpath` value ("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]"). The outdated assertion is removed and replaced with the expected text "The email address is not valid".
