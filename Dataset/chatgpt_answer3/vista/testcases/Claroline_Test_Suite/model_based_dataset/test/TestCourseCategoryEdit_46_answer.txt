The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Category modified");

Explanation: 
I have updated the XPath locator of the element to "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" based on the selected element with similar properties. 

The outdated assertion has been updated with the correct element locator and the expected text "Category modified".
