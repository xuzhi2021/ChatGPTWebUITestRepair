Repaired statement: assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "The new user has been sucessfully created");

Explanation: 
The repaired statement updates the XPath locator to "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" based on the selected element. The outdated assertion remains the same, checking if the text equals "The new user has been sucessfully created".
