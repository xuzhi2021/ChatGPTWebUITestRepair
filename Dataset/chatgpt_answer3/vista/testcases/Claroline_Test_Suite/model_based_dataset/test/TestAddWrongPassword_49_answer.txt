Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(),

Explanation: The locator in the broken statement was updated to use the XPath "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" based on the selected element. The outdated assertion was removed and replaced with the updated locator for the element's text.
