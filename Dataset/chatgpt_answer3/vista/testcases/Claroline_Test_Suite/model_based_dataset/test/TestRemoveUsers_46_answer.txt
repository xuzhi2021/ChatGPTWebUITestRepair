The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully");

Explanation: 
The repaired statement replaces the xpath locator with a more specific xpath locator ("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]") that points to the selected element. 

The outdated assertion remains the same, which checks if the text of the selected element is equal to "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully".
