The most similar element's numericId: 150. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, tagName.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[6]/a[1]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[2]/td[1]/form[1]/input[3]")).sendKeys("Category1");

Explanation: 
The selected element has a similar xpath value as the target element. Therefore, I updated the locator to use the xpath instead of the name. The updated statement should find the input element using the xpath and then send the keys "Category1" to it.
