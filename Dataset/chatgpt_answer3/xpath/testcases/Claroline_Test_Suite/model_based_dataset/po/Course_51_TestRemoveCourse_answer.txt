The most similar element's numericId: 35. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: 

```
String message = driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div[1]/div")).getText();
```

Explanation: 

The repaired statement updates the XPath to locate the element with the desired text. The new XPath `/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div[1]/div` is based on the selected element's XPath property (`/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]`) and it accurately locates the target element. The getText() method is used to retrieve the text content of the element.

Please note that the repaired statement assumes that the XPath provided is the correct one to locate the desired element. If the element is not found using this XPath, you may need to adjust it further based on the structure of the HTML page.
