The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "You typed two different passwords");

Explanation: 
The repaired statement uses the xpath locator "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" to locate the element with the text "You typed two different passwords". This xpath is based on the selected element which is the closest match to the target element. The updated statement should now work correctly.
