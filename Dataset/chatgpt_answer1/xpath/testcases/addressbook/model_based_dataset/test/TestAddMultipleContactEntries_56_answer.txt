The most similar element's numericId: 146. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, text, x, y, width, height.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[4]/form[1]/input[11]")).sendKeys(list.get(i).getYear());

Explanation: 

1. The selected element has the following properties:
   - tagName: input
   - xpath: /html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[4]/form[1]/input[11]

2. Based on the selected element, the updated locator in the repaired statement is the xpath.

3. The outdated assertion in the broken statement is "(//INPUT[@type='text'])[11]". Since the selected element is not a text input, the assertion should be updated to match the selected element's properties. 

Repaired statement result: The repaired statement will find the 11th input element in the specified xpath and send the value of list.get(i).getYear() to it.
