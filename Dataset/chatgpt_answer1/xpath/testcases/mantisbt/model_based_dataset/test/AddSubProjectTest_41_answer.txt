Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]")).click();

Explanation: 
- The original statement was using a partial XPath locator to find the element with the attribute `href` equal to "manage_proj_page.php".
- However, the provided candidate element list does not have any element with a similar attribute.
- The repaired statement uses the selected element from the candidate list as the new XPath locator.
- The repaired statement clicks on the element that has the same XPath as the selected element.
