Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[6]/a[1]/table[1]/tbody[1]/tr[3]/td[1]")).sendKeys("Category1");

Explanation: 
- The original statement was using the locator strategy "By.name" to find the element, but the selected element does not have a name attribute.
- The repaired statement uses the locator strategy "By.xpath" to find the element based on the selected element's XPath.
- The outdated assertion in the original statement is not mentioned, so it remains the same.
