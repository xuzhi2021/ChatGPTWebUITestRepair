The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div[1]")).getText(), "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully");

Explanation: 

- I replaced the XPath locator "//div[@id='claroBody']/div[2]/div" with "/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div[1]" based on the selected element.

Result of the repaired statement: 

assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div[1]")).getText(), "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully");
