The most similar element's numericId: 23. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text, tagName, x, y, width, height, and isLeaf values.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]/h3")).getText(), "Authentication");

Explanation: 
- The locator in the broken statement is using the ID attribute, but the selected element does not have an ID. So, the xpath locator should be used instead.
- The outdated assertion method `assertTrue` is replaced with `assertEquals` to compare the text value of the selected element with the expected value "Authentication".
