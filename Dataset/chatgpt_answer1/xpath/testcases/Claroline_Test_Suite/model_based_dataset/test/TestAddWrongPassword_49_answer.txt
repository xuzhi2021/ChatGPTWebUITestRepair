Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div")).getText(), "You typed two different passwords");

Explanation: 

Updated locator: /html/body/div/div[2]/div/div
Outdated assertion: //*[@id=\"claroBody\"]/div[2]/div[1]).getText()

The repaired statement uses the selected element's xpath ("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div") as the updated locator and compares its text with the expected text "You typed two different passwords".
