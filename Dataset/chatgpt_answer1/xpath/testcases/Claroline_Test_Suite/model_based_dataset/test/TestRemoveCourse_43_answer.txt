The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div")).click();

Explanation: 
Based on the selected element {numericId=39, id='', name='', class='claroDialogMsg msgSuccess', xpath='/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]', text='The course has been successfully deleted', tagName='div', linkText='', x=40, y=158, width=876, height=18, isLeaf=true}, the updated locator is "/html/body/div/div[2]/div/div" which represents the target element. The outdated assertion is not specified in the provided broken statement, so it remains unchanged.
