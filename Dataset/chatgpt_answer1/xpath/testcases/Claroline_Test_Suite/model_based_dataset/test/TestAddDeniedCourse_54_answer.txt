Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "You have just created the course website : 225");

Explanation: 
- Updated the XPath locator to match the selected element based on numericId 35.
- Removed the duplicate getText() method call in the assertion.
