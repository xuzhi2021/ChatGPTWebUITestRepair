The most similar element's numericId: 48. Because they share the most similar attributes: xpath, text, tagName, linkText, x, y, width, height, isLeaf.
Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]")).click();

Explanation: 

Based on the selected element with the numericId=48, the updated xpath locator would be "/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]" as the most similar to the target element.

The outdated assertion of the broken statement is checking the href attribute value, which is now removed in the repaired statement.

Result of repaired statement: 

driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]")).click();
