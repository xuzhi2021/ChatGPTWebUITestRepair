Repaired statement: 

driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]")).click(); 

Explanation: 

The repaired statement uses a more specific XPath locator to identify the "Manage Projects" link. The previous locator used the attribute "href" to locate the element, but it is not necessary and may not be unique enough. Instead, the updated locator uses the complete XPath expression of the element. 

Please note that this repaired statement assumes that the element with the given XPath expression is indeed the "Manage Projects" link. If there are multiple elements matching this XPath expression, or if the page structure changes, the locator may need to be adjusted accordingly.
