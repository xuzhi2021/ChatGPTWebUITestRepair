The most similar element's numericId: 68. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Exercise added");

Explanation: 
- Updated the XPath locator to target the element with similar characteristics to the selected element (numericId=68, class='claroDialogMsg msgSuccess', text='Exercise added').
- Removed the duplicated portion of the locator that was causing a syntax error.
- Updated the expected assertion value to "Exercise added".
