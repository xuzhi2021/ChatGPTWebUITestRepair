The most similar element's numericId: 68. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Event added to the agenda.");

Explaination: The original XPath locator was replaced with a more specific one that matches the selected element. The outdated assertion was also updated to match the text value of the selected element.
