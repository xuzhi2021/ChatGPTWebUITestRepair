The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully");

Explanation: The xpath of the selected element is "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]", which is different from the xpath in the broken statement "//div[@id='claroBody']/div[2]/div". The updated xpath in the repaired statement matches the selected element's xpath. Therefore, the repaired statement should be able to assert the correct text.
