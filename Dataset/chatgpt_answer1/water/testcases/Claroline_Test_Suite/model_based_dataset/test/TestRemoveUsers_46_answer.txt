The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully");

Explanation: 
Based on the selected element {numericId=39, id='', name='', class='claroDialogMsg msgSuccess', xpath='/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]', text='Deletion of the user was done sucessfully', tagName='div', linkText='', x=40, y=158, width=893, height=18, isLeaf=true}, the xpath has been updated to "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" to match the element. The outdated assertion has been updated to check if the text of the selected element matches the expected value "Deletion of the user was done sucessfully".
