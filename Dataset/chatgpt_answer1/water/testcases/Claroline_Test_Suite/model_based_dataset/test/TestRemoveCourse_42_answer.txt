The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: 

```java
driver.findElement(By.xpath("//div[contains(@class,'claroDialogMsg') and contains(text(),'The course has been successfully deleted')]")).click();
```

Explanation: 
- Updated the XPath to locate the element with the class "claroDialogMsg" and containing the text "The course has been successfully deleted".
- Removed the unnecessary part of the XPath "/div[@id='claroBody']".
- The repaired statement clicks on the element that indicates the successful deletion of the course.

Please note that the repaired statement assumes that there is only one element on the page with the class "claroDialogMsg" and the text "The course has been successfully deleted". If there are multiple elements with the same class and text, you may need to modify the XPath accordingly to ensure the correct element is selected.
