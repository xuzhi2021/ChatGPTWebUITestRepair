The most similar element's numericId: 39. Because they share the most similar attributes: class, xpath, text.
Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]")).getText(), "The email address is not valid");

Explanation: 
- Updated the xpath locator to "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[1]" based on the selected element.
- Removed the duplicated part of the locator and the unnecessary closing parenthesis in the assertion.
- Kept the same assertion message "The email address is not valid".
