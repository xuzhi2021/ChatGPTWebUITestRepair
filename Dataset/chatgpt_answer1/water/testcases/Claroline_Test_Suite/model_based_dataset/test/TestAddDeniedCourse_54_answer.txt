Repaired statement: Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]")).getText(), "You have just created the course website : 225");

Explanation: 
- Updated the xpath locator to match the selected element: "/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[1]/div[2]"
- Removed the extra ".getText()" at the end of the statement
- Kept the expected text value as "You have just created the course website : 225"
