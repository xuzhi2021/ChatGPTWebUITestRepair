Repaired statement:

```java
Assert.assertEquals(driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]")).getText(), "You typed two different passwords");
```

The repaired statement uses the xpath locator based on the selected element with the xpath `/html[1]/body[1]/div[1]/div[2]/div[1]/div[2]`. The assertion checks if the text of the selected element is equal to "You typed two different passwords".
