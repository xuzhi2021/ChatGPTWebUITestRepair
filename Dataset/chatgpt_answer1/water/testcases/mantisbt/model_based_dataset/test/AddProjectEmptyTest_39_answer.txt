Repaired statement: driver.findElement(By.xpath("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]")).click();

Explanation: Based on the selected element, the repaired locator is the full xpath of the element ("/html[1]/body[1]/div[2]/p[1]/span[2]/a[1]"). We use this xpath to locate the "Manage Projects" link. Then we perform the click action on the element.

Updated assertion: The repaired statement does not contain any assertion. You may need to add an assertion after the click action to verify the expected behavior or state of the application.
